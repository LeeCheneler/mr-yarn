# Contributing to Mr Yarn

This repository is a Yarn Workspaces mono repo powered by Mr Yarn himself!

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Because of this before Mr Yarn will work within this repo the first thing we need to do is build it:

```
yarn build
```

Before contributing code to a package ensure you visit it and read it's README. Every package has one.

## Quality Control

Lint all packages:

```
yarn lint
```

Run all tests:

**Ensure that you build before running the integration tests**

```
yarn test
```

## Helping hands

Clean the repository of things such as build artefacts and node modules:

```
yarn clean
```
